2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/Royalgamer06/steam-free-packages/archive/master.zip)
3. Extract it anywhere and run install.bat (one-time only) to install the needed libraries
4. Edit config.json and include your information and preferences
5. Run run.bat any time after completing step 1-4
6. Minimize if you wish and it will periodically request free packages for your steam account

Good luck!
